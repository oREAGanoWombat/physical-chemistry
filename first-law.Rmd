### Work and Heat
#### James P. Joule (1818-1889)
- Joule was one of the pioneers of modern thermodynamics.
- Among his experiments, Joule attempted to measure the effect of work on the temperature of water.

### The First Law of Thermodynamics

:::: {.whitebox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
The capacity of a system to do work is increased by heating the system or doing work on it.
:::
::::
- The first law translates to
$$\Delta {U}={q}+{w}$$
$${dU}={dq}+{dw}$$

### Heat
- Heat is the flow of energy that, in the absence of other changes, will change the temperature of the system.
- **Endothermic**: heat flows into the system ($q_{system}>0$)
- **Exothermic**: heat flows out of the system ($q_{system}<0$)
- An infinitesimal amount of heat flowing can be related to the temperature change as 
$${dq}={CdT}$$
  where $C$ is the heat capacity

**Example 3.1**

How much energy is needed to raise the temperature of $5.0g$ of water from $21.0^{o}C$ to $25.0^{o}C$?
::::

#### Side Note: Partial Derivative
- The ideal gas law tells us that 
$${P(V.n.T)}=\frac{nRT}{V}$$
- How do we calculate the infinitesimal change in the pressure ($dP$) if all the variable can change?
- The infinitesimal change in any function can be calculated as
$${df}=\sum_{i}\left( \frac{\delta f}{\delta x_{i}} \right )_{x_{j}\neq {i}}{dx}_{i}$$

### Work
- Work can take various forms, some of which we have already spoken about  
<center>**Type of Work Displacement Resistance**<center>
- Expansion: 
$${dw}=-P_{ext}{dV}$$
- Electrical: 
$${dw}=-W{dQ}$$
- Extension: 
$${dw}={TdL}$$
- Stretching: 
$${dw}={sdA}$$

**Example 3.2**

What is the work done by $1.00{mol}$ of an ideal gas expanding from a volume of $22.4L$ to a volume of $44.8L$ against a constant external pressure of $0.500{atm}$?

### Reversible Gas Expansions
- Imagine a gas in a cylinder (with a piston) where the pressure of the gas and the external pressure are the same.
- There is no spontaneous change of the gas towards seeking larger or smaller volume
- Since the internal pressure ($P$) and the external pressure ($P{ext}$) are the same
$${dw}=-P_{ext}{dV}=-P{dV}$$

:::: {.whitebox data-latex=""}
**Solving Reversible Gas Expansion**

${dw}=-P_{ext}{dV}=-P{dV}$

$$
\begin{align}
w &= -\int {PdV} \\
  &= -\int \left ( \frac{nRT}{V} \right ) \\
  &= -{nRT} \int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V} = -{nRT}ln\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\
\end{align}
$$

**Example 3.3**

What is the work done by $1.00{mol}$ of an ideal gas expanding reversibly from a volume of $22.4{L}$ to a volume of $44.8{L}$ at a constant temperature of $273K$?

**Note:** Isothermal Processes of an Ideal Gas

- Isothermal means the process occurs at a constant temperature
- Ideal gases, due to its assumptions, can only store energy as kinetic energy
- Changing kinetic energy means changing temperature
- So, no change in temperature means no change in $U$
- $\Delta U = 0\therefore q = -w$ for isothermal processes involving ideal gases

### Reaction Enthalpies
- Reaction enthalpies are difficult to tabulate
- We can us Hess' Law to simplify this
- We can use tabulated enthalpies to calculate the enthalpies of other reactions

#### Example 3.11
Find $\Delta H_{rxn}$

---

### Standard Enthalpy of Formation 
$\Delta H_{rxn}^{o}$  
- One problem with many thermodynamic state variables is that it is possible to measure changes but not absolute values  
- It is therefore necessary to define a zero  
  - the standard enthalpy of formation of a pure element in its standard state is zero  

<center>  
**The standard state of a substance is the most stable form of that substance at 1 atmosphere pressure and the specified temperature.**
<center>

---

### Standard Formation Reactions
- We measure and tabulate the standard formation reactions for compounds
- These reactions involve one of the substance in its standard state from the elements in their standard states

- ${NaCl}{(s)}$

$${Na(s)}+\frac{1}{2}{Cl}_{2}{(g)} \rightarrow {NaCl(s)}$$
