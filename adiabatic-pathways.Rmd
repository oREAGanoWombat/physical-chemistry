- An adiabatic pathway is one in which no heat is transfered, $dq=0$.
- If an ideal gas expands adiabatically, it is doing work against the surrounds ($w<0$) so the internal energy must drop ($\Delta U<0$)
- Because the internal energy of an ideal gas depends solely on the temperature, if $\Delta U<0$ then $\Delta T<0$

<h4> <a href=reversible-expansion.html> Reversible </a> Adiabatic Expansion of an Ideal Gas </h4>
We know that
$$dw=-PdV$$
and
$$dw=nC_VdT$$
therefore
$$-PdV=nC_VdT$$
Using the ideal gas law we find that
$$- \frac{nRT}{V}dV=nC_VdT$$

Integrating to get to macroscopic changes
$$\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V} = - \frac{C_V}{R} \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{dT}{T}$$
which solves to
$$ln \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) =- \frac{C_V}{R} ln \left(\frac{T_2}{T_2} \right)$$
$$\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) ^{\frac{C_V}{R}} \Rightarrow T_1 \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) ^{\frac{R}{C_V}} = T_2$$

**Example 3.7**

$1.00mol$ of an ideal gas ($C_V=\frac{3}{2} R$) initially occupies $22.4L$ at $273K$. The gas expands adiabatically and reversibly to a final volume of $44.8L$. Calculate $\Delta T$, $q$, $w$, $\Delta U$, and $\Delta H$ for the expansion.
