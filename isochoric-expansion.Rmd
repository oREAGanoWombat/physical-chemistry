### Constant Volume "Expansion"
- If a gas is constrained by sufficient force, it cannot change volume therefore ${dV}=0$
- So,
$${dU}={dq}+{dw}={dq}-{PdV}={dq}$$
- Since, ${dq}={CdT}$
$${dU}={CdT}$$
- This gives us an important definition for the constant volume heat capacity
$${C_{V}}\equiv \left ( \frac{\delta U}{\delta T} \right )_{V}$$
- **Note:** $q=\int_{T_1}^{T_2}{nC_{V}dT}$

**Example 3.4**

Consider $1.00mol$ of an ideal gas with $C_V=\frac{3}{2}R$ that undergoes a temperature change from $125K$ to $255K$ at a constant volume of $10.0L$. Calculate $\DeltaU$, $q$, and $w$ for this change.
