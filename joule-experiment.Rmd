<h3>Measuring the Internal Pressure</h3>
<ul>
<li>James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) set out to measure the internal pressure</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=https://shaunmwilliams.com/CHE303/figures/PuttingTheFirstLawToWork/JouleExperiment.png alt="Two copper spheres, A and B, connected by a stopcock emmersed in a tank of water containing a thermometer. Sphere A is filled with a sample of gas while sphere B is evacuated."></p>
<ul>
<li>A has a sample gas while B is evacuated</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>The Experiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the stopcock is opened, the gas expands into sphere B so \(\Delta V>0\)</li>
<li>Since B originally had a vacuum, this expansion is done against no external pressure so \(P_{ext}=0\,\therefore\, dw=-P_{ext}\,dV=0\)</li>
<li>We know that \(dU=dq+dw\) and that \(dU=\pi_T\,dV + C_V\,dT\) so
\[ \pi_T\,dV + C_V\, dT = dq + dw = dq \]
</li>
<li>Joule observed no temperature change in the water so he concluded that \(dq=0\) and \(dT=0\)</li>
<li>Since \(dV>0\) (the gas is expanding), Joule concluded that \(\pi_T=0\)</li>
<li>In truth, \(dT\ne 0\), but it was too small for Joule to detect it</li>
</ul>
<p>\[ \pi_T=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T = T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V-P \]</p>

<center><h2><mark>The Joule-Thomson Effect</mark></h2></center>
- In 1852, Joule Began working with William Thomson (who would later become Lord Kelvin)

<h3>The Joule-Thomson Experiment</h3>
<p><img src=https://shaunmwilliams.com/CHE303/figures/PuttingTheFirstLawToWork/JouleThomsonApparatus.png alt="A depiction of the apparatus described on this slide."></p>
<ul>
<li>Gas is pumped into the left side of a lead pipe at a constant rate</li>
<li>The pipe has a constriction in it so that the pressure in the left chamber is higher than the right chamber.</li>
<li>The temperature is monitored in each chamber.</li>
</ul>
<b>In theory, the temperature should increase when the volume increases. Since this experiment allowed volume to increase and pressure to decrease, they were able to observe how temperature is affected when both of these variables are changed.</b>

$\;$

<h3>The Joule-Thomson Coefficient</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Not all gases cool as they expand from high pressure to low pressure</b></li>
<li>The sign of \(\Delta T\) can be determined by measuring the Joule-Thomson coefficient ($\mu_{JT}$)
\[ \mu_{JT}\equiv \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H \]
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=https://shaunmwilliams.com/CHE303/figures/PuttingTheFirstLawToWork/JouleThomsonCoefficientBehavior.png height="300" alt="A plot of temperature versus pressure. The is a region at moderate temperature where the Joule-Thomson Coefficient is positive. Elsewhere it is negative."></p>

<h3>Working to Make \(\mu_{JT}\) Measurable</h3>
<ul>
<li>We can develop an equation for calculating \(\mu_{JT}\) in terms of measurable quantities. But first</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[ dH \equiv \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_TdP + \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_PdT \]
We will show later that
\[ \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_TdP = -T\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P+V \]
The second term of which can be written in terms of the isobaric thermal expansivity
\[ \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_TdP = -TV\alpha +V = V\left(1-T\alpha\right) \]
\[ dH \equiv \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_TdP + \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_PdT \]
Divide each side by \(dP\) and constrain to constant \(H\)
\[ \left. \frac{dH}{dP}\right|_H = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T\,\left.\frac{dP}{dP}\right|_H + \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P\,\left.\frac{dT}{dP}\right|_H \]
This can be simplified
\[ 0 = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T\,\left(1\right) + \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P\,\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H \]
\[ 0 = V \left(1-T\alpha\right) + \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P\,\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H \]
We can use out definitions of \( C_P=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P \) and <mark>\( \mu_{JT}=\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H \)</mark>
\[ 0 = V \left(1-T\alpha\right) + C_P\mu_{JT} \]
This can be solved to find that
\[ \mu_{JT} = \frac{V\left(T\alpha -1\right)}{C_P} = \frac{V}{C_P}\left(T\alpha-1\right) \]
</p>

<h2>Useful Definitions and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heat Capacities
\[ C_V\equiv \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V \;\text{ and }\; C_P\equiv \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P \]
</li>
<li>Coefficient of Thermal <a href=gas-expansion.html>Expansion</a>
\[ \alpha \equiv \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P \Rightarrow \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = V\alpha\]
</li>
<li><a href=isothermal-expansion.html>Isothermal</a> Compressibility
\[ \kappa_T \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T \Rightarrow \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T = -V\kappa_T \]
</li>
<li>We have also seen that
\[ \begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\alpha}{\kappa_T} &=& \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V \\
\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T &=& T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V-P \\
\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T &=& -T\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P+V
\end{eqnarray} \]
</li>
