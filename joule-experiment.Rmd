<h3>Measuring the Internal Pressure</h3>
<ul>
<li>James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) set out to measure the internal pressure</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A has a sample gas while B is evacuated</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Experiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the stopcock is opened, the gas expands into sphere B so \(\Delta V>0\)</li>
<li>Since B originally had a vacuum, this expansion is done against no external pressure so \(P_{ext}=0\,\therefore\, dw=-P_{ext}\,dV=0\)</li>
<li>We know that \(dU=dq+dw\) and that \(dU=\pi_T\,dV + C_V\,dT\) so
\[ \pi_T\,dV + C_V\, dT = dq + dw = dq \]
</li>
<li>Joule observed no temperature change in the water so he concluded that \(dq=0\) and \(dT=0\)</li>
<li>Since \(dV>0\) (the gas is expanding), Joule concluded that \(\pi_T=0\)</li>
<li>In truth, \(dT\ne 0\), but it was too small for Joule to detect it</li>
</ul>
<p>\[ \pi_T=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T = T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V-P \]</p>
